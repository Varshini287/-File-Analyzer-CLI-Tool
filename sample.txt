Thereâ€™s a special kind of joy that radiates from her eyes, a joy that seems to dance in the warm summer air. a quaint house nestled amidst lush green hills, surrounded by sprawling coffee plantations that stretch as far as the eye can see. The aroma of fresh coffee beans wafts through the open windows, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.
In this idyllic setting, a grandmother and her granddaughter share moments filled with laughter and love. They wander through the vibrant fields, picking ripe coffee cherries together, their hands stained with nature's bounty. The sun beams down on them, casting a golden glow on their joyful faces as they exchange stories tales of old and dreams yet to be realized.
